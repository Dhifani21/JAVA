📝 Pushing Code From Eclipse to GitHub — Step‑by‑Step Notes
✔ Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

Log in to GitHub
Click New Repository
Enter repo name → Example: saucedemo-automation
Leave it empty (no README, no .gitignore)
Click Create Repository


✔ Step 2: Open Your Project in Eclipse
Make sure your project is already created and imported in Eclipse.

✔ Step 3: Enable Git (if not enabled)

Right‑click your project
Select:
Team → Share Project
Select Git
Click Next → Finish

This initializes Git inside your Eclipse project.

✔ Step 4: Commit Your Code

Right‑click the project
Select Team → Commit
Add a commit message like:
"Initial commit"
Select all files
Click Commit (or Commit and Push if available)


✔ Step 5: Add GitHub as Remote
If you chose Commit only, now do:

Right‑click your project
Select Team → Remote → Push
In URI, paste your GitHub repo link:
https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git


Enter GitHub username + PAT token (not password)
Click Next


✔ Step 6: Select Branch for Push

Under "Source ref" → select master or main
Under "Destination ref" → select refs/heads/main
Click Add Spec
Click Next
Click Finish


✔ Step 7: Verify on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repo → refresh the page → you should see all your code uploaded.

🟦 PUSH SHORTCUT (If available)
If your Eclipse already shows Commit and Push, you can do:
Right‑click → Team → Commit and Push

And skip remote setup.

🟥 If push fails:
Usually it is because:

Wrong username/password
GitHub now requires PAT (Personal Access Token)
Wrong branch name (main vs master)
Repository already has content
ZIP or binary blocked by .gitignore
